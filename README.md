# Economy

This module aims to provide a very generic framework to simulate an economy with consumers and producers. On top of that however, it provides a robust method to share/trade/exchange resources between entities. It does so under a very libertarian credo: Use any storage component you want.

To see how you can get started with it and how you can hook it into your module see the [wiki](https://github.com/Terasology/Economy/wiki)!
